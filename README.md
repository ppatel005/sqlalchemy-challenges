# sqlalchemy-challenges
I used AskBCS and tutoring help for this homework assigment. Both helped me decode some of the lines that I was struggling with. 

I also used overflow stack on the time portion of the app.py

I used https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/errors.html#error-e3q8 to try to troubleshoot my errors for the app.py portion
